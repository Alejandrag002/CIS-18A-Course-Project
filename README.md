# CIS-18A-Course-Project
This Is my CIS-18A Java Course Project

Option 1: Business Program
Write a Java program to place order and set appointment for delivery of goods or services from a 
business of your choice (restaurant, grocery, mobile pet spa, mobile car detailer, home cleaning, home 
repair/improvement, mobile car repair, etc....).

  My java project's main purpose is to order a cake and have it delivered to their home. The
targeted audience is a cake/bakery business that does not yet have any online ordering.The day
the instruction/description of the project came out, I was playing with my little cousin and her
toy kitchen, she would ask what kind of cake I wanted, and then she would “bake” the cake and
deliver it to me, this interaction inspired my idea for the project!The goal of the program is to
acquire the type of cake the customer wants, and the day and time they would like it delivered.
When the customer has finalized their order, their receipt with the name on the order, delivery
date, type of cake they ordered, any additional cake toppings, and their total will be displayed.
  My program begins with welcoming the customer to “Ale’s Cakes” and notifying them of
the days and the times we are open and able to deliver. It then displays five cake options and
their corresponding prices as well as the two toppings with their prices that the customer may or
may not choose to add. It then prompts the user to type in the number of the cake option they
desire, and type in “Yes” or “No” if they wish to add any topping to the cake, if the user types
“Yes” then the toppings are displayed again, prompting the user to choose their topping, if the
user said no then the program asks for a name to correlate with the order. Once the name is input,
the program displays the upcoming 7 days and the times between 11 am and 5 pm and asks the
user to pick a delivery day. After the delivery date is chosen, the program displays the customer's
receipt with the name on the order, delivery date, type of cake they ordered, any additional cake 
toppings, and their total. A weakness my program has is the user cannot pick more than one cake
or toppings per order, if the customer wanted multiple cakes and toppings they would have to put
in multiple orders. A strength in my program is I was able to implement dates for the upcoming 7
days and the available times for delivery, I struggled the absolute most with that aspect. Overall
my program runs effectively for customers to place a cake order and receive their receipt.
