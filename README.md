# CIS-18A-Course-Project
This Is my CIS-18A Java Course Project

Option 1: Business Program
Write a Java program to place order and set appointment for delivery of goods or services from a 
business of your choice (restaurant, grocery, mobile pet spa, mobile car detailer, home cleaning, home 
repair/improvement, mobile car repair, etc....).

My java project's main purpose is to order a cake and have it delivered to their home. The
targeted audience is a cake/bakery business that does not yet have any online ordering.The goal of the program is to
acquire the type of cake the customer wants, and the day and time they would like it delivered.
When the customer has finalized their order, their receipt with the name on the order, delivery
date, type of cake they ordered, any additional cake toppings, and their total will be displayed.
